1. Loop statements:
       when we use the looping statements?
            -> sometimes we need to execute the block of code repeatedly  when the condition is true then these loop statements are used
            -> In java, they are 3 looping statements:
                   * for : In for loop they are 3 parameters 
                           for(Initialization,condition,increment/decrement)
                           Intialization : it initializes the loop varaible
                           condition     : it checks the condition
                           increment/decrement : it increments/decrements the value of a varaible in a single line of code
                         Syntax of for loop:
                              for(Initialization,condition,increment/decrement)
                              {
                                  //block of code
                              }
                         examples : program to check whether the number is prime or not?
                                    program to find sum of n natural numbers?

                         Example : program
                              public class Example5
                               {
                                  public static void main(String args[])
                                  {
                                     for(int i=0;i<5;i++)
                                     {
                                        System.out.println(i);
                                      }
                                   }
                                 }
                         
                   * while : the while loop is also used to iterate over number of statements and here we dont know number of iterations in advance 
                          Syntax of while loop:
                               while(condition)
                               {
                                   //block of code
                               }
                          examples : program to find the sum of digits of a number
                                     program to check whether the given number is palindrome or not?
                                     program to find reverse of a number 
 
                          Example : program
                               public class Example6
                               {
                                  public static void main(String args[])
                                  {
                                     int i=0;
                                     while(i<5)
                                     {
                                       System.out.println(i);
                                       i++;
                                      }
                                    }
                                  }
                   * do-while : the do-while loop is also used to iterate the part of the program repeatedly until the condition is true 
                                the do-while loop executes the code once despite of the condition because in do-while the conditon is checked at the end of program
                             Syntax of do-while loop:
                                  do
                                  {
                                     //block of code
                                  }while(condition)
                             Example : program
                                  public class Example7
                                 {
                                    public static void main(String args[])
                                    {
                                       int i=1;
                                       do
                                       {
                                         System.out.println(i);
                                         i++;
                                       }while(i<=5);
                                     }
                                   }
