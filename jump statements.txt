1. Jump statements : break,continue
        -> break : in java break statement is used to break the loop it breaks the current flow of the program at specific condition
                 Syntax of break statement:
                           break;
                 Example : program
                         public class Example8
                         {
                            public static void main(String args[])
                            {
                                for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)
                                {
                                   if(i==9)
                                      break; // means it breaks the flow of program at specific condition that means it prints from 1 to 8
                                   System.out.println(i);
                                 }
                               }
                             }
             -> continue : in Java continue statement is used to continue the flow of the program and skips the code at specific condition.
                        Syntax of continue statement:
                                  continue;
                        Example : program
                                public class Example9
                                {
                                   public static void main(String args[])
                                   {
                                      for(int i=0;i<=10;i++)
                                      {
                                         if(i==5)
                                             continue;  // means it prints all the numbers from 1 to 10 except 5 
                                         System.out.println(i);
                                       }
                                     }
                                   }

2. Comments : 
         what is a comment?
               comment is a statement of program that is not executed by the compiler.
         what is the use of comments?
               by using the comments we can understand the code easily and it provides the information about varaibles,classes or any statements
               they are 2 types of comments:
               * single-line comments : single line comments are used for only for the single line code
                                        It is denoted as (//)two forward slashes 
                                  Example : program
                                  public class Example10
                                  {
                                     public static void main(String args[])
                                     {
                                          int a=10,b=20;
                                          int c=a+b; // adding a and b and it stores the value in varaible c
                                          System.out.println(c);
                                      }
                                    }
                                          
               * multi-line comments : multi line comments are used for multiple lines of code
                                       It is denoted by (/* */)
                                  Example : program
                                  public class Example11
                                  {
                                     public static void main(String args[])
                                     {
                                          /* int a=30;
                                             int b=40;
                                             int c=a+b;*/
                                          int a=10,b=20;
                                          int c=a+b; 
                                          System.out.println(c);
                                      }
                                    }
